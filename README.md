# LIFL_IE_Nest-Simulator_Extension_Module

Nest-Simulator Extension Module containing a LeakyIFwithLatency neuron model expressing Intrinsic Excitability (IE) plasticity. This Nest Simulator library offers the opportunity to create polychrony architectures able to perform Multi Neural Spyke-sequence Detections (MNSD)

This package contains 1) the Nest-Simulator module that can be installed following their instructions (https://nest.github.io/nest-simulator/extension_modules) thereby "lifl_psc_exp_ie" and "aeif_psc_exp_peak" neuron models are installed. 2) Two examples of use of this Module Extension architecture; First, a 4 delay neurons to 1 target decoder script called "MNSD_with_LIFL_IE.py". Second, the folder containing the scripts used to create a V1 Oriented Column and reproduce its oriented selectivity function. Then, current signal from this model and real magnetoencephalography are compared.
